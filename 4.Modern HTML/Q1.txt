Here is a list of key features of HTML5:

Semantics:
1) Introduction of new semantic elements like <article>, <section>, <nav>, <header>, <footer>, <aside>, <figure>, and <figcaption. These elements enhance the structural clarity of web documents.

Audio and Video:
2) Native support for embedding audio and video elements (<audio> and <video>), making multimedia integration easier without the need for third-party plugins (like Flash).

Canvas:
3) The <canvas> element allows dynamic rendering of graphics and images directly within the browser. It is used for drawing shapes, images, and complex animations using JavaScript.

Local Storage:
4) Introduction of localStorage and sessionStorage for storing key-value pairs locally on the client side. This provides a more robust and persistent client-side storage solution compared to cookies.

Geolocation:
5) Native support for obtaining the user's geographical location through the Geolocation API. This enables web applications to provide location-based services.

Offline Web Applications:
4) The introduction of the Application Cache (appcache) allows web applications to work offline by caching resources and assets locally.

Web Workers:
5) The Web Workers API allows the execution of JavaScript code in the background, separate from the main thread. This enables parallel processing, improving performance for complex tasks.

WebSockets:
6) Native support for real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and the server using the WebSocket API. This is especially useful for applications that require low-latency communication.

Responsive Design:
7) HTML5 provides features like the <meta> viewport tag and media queries to facilitate the development of responsive and mobile-friendly web designs.

Form Enhancements:
8) New input types, such as <input type="date">, <input type="email">, <input type="url">, and more, make it easier to capture specific types of user input. Additionally, attributes like required and pattern enhance form validation.

New Document Outline:
9) HTML5 introduces a simplified and more flexible document outline with new sectioning elements, improving the structure and accessibility of web documents.

Drag and Drop:
10) Native support for drag-and-drop functionality with the Drag and Drop API, making it easier to create interactive interfaces.

Web Storage:
11) Besides local storage, HTML5 introduced session storage, allowing web applications to store data for the duration of a page session.

Enhanced Accessibility:
12) New attributes and elements, along with improved semantics, contribute to better accessibility for assistive technologies.

Security Improvements:
13) Enhanced security features, such as the <sandbox> attribute for iframes, contribute to a more secure browsing experience.
