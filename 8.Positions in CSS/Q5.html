<!-- The z-index property in CSS is used to control the stacking order of positioned elements, primarily those with a position value of absolute, relative, fixed, or sticky. It determines the order in which elements are stacked on top of each other along the z-axis, creating a 3D-like effect even though web pages are inherently 2D. -->
