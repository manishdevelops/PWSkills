JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development to create interactive and dynamic web pages. It runs in the browser and enables developers to add functionality, manipulate content, and respond to user actions in real-time. JavaScript plays a crucial role in web development by enhancing the user experience, handling client-side logic, and facilitating interactions with web applications without the need to reload the entire page.
