In JavaScript, there are five primitive data types:

1. Number: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers. JavaScript uses the Number data type to store both whole numbers and decimals.
Example: 
let age = 25;
let price = 9.99;

2. String: Represents textual data enclosed in single ' ' or double " " quotes. Strings can contain letters, digits, symbols, and whitespace characters.
Example:
let name = 'John Doe';
let message = "Hello, world!";

3. Boolean: Represents a logical value indicating either true or false. Booleans are commonly used for conditional expressions and logical operations.
Example:
let isActive = true;
let isLoggedOut = false;

4. Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value. If a variable is declared without initializing it, its value is automatically set to undefined.
Example:
let variable; // undefined

5. Null: Represents an intentional absence of any value. It is often used to signify that a variable or object property does not have a value or does not exist.
Example:
let score = null;
