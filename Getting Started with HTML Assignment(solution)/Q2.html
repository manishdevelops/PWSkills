 <!-- 2. Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide an example of how to use comments in an HTML
document.

Answer: 
Comments in HTML serve as non-rendered text that provides information about the code for human readers.
They are useful for documenting your code, explaining its purpose, making notes, or temporarily disabling parts of the code without deleting them. Comments are ignored by browsers and do not affect the rendering of the webpage.

Example: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML Comments Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- This is a comment in HTML. -->
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>

    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>

    <!-- The following section is for images -->
    <div>
        <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
        <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Image 2">
    </div>

    <!-- Footer section -->
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2023 My Website. All rights reserved.</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
